Hello, my name is Yuhan Wang and I am from Dalian Maritime University(211). In the past five semesters, my GPA is 4.34/5 and the rank is 2/92. My research interests in postgraduate include IC design, Chip development, Machine Learning and BioMedical Enginnering. Standing in the intersaction of AI and modern theory, I believe the intelligent system of our times has come to a turning point. I will be committed to developing the AI-based theory and applying it to various fields, including medicine, telecommunication, hardware and so on.
